#AggreGator HTML
---------------------------------

###HTML on Google Sites
The HTML we use on our website was made externally at [scratchpad.io](www.scratchpad.io). It's a good tool, I highly recommend using it to make changes and build skeletons for a new page.

The HTML for a page can be accessed by clicking the edit function

![](/html1.png)

Then clicking HTML

![](/html2.png)

w3schools is a good palce to get refreshers or exposure to a subject, but not the ideal source. Learn from here as though you were being given a crash course, not the Bible- not that I'm religious.
