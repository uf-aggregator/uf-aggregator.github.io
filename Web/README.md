###Web Hosting

Every website has a domain. A domain is the name of the website, i.e. facebook.com, youtube.com, ufaggregator.com.
A domain is not a website however.

Domains are purchased by registered vendors. Once you buy one, you can use it however you want. It can be pointed towards another website, have a website directed towards it, or be associated with an IP address.

Web pages are hosted documents. They can be associated with domains. A lot of website vendors pair a domain and hosting together in one package (i.e. GoDaddy, Wix). 

We are using Google Sites as our host and our own domain.

###Editing with Google Sites
_Warning: Google Sites and many site building applications are terrible ways to learn web development. They're an okay starting point, but you'll gain much more from a from-scratch experience. That said, we're programming a robot, not making the next Facebook._


####Terms

**HTML**
-- Hyper Text Markup Language. This is the defacto way to describe the content of a web page. Most web-pages will have an HTML file(s) of some form.

**CSS** - Cascading Stylesheet. This is the defacto way to _prettify_ the content described by HTML. There are different ways to produce a CSS file.

CSS can also be used _inline_ of an HTML _element_.

**User Agent** - The user agent is the computer viewing the web page.

####Gadgets

Google Gadgets are Google hosted javascript apps that can be used within a Google Site. Use these sparingly as they have a load latency and have constrictions.

####Text and Images

You can edit a Google site's content with their web editor. However, it is preferred you use HTML as there is more control over what is displayed.

All HTML is in the /html folder above and if a site component is not in there, it is a Google gadget or site plug-in.
